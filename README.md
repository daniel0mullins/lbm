# Branch Manager

I personally hate doing a bunch of `git branch -D thebranch` operations, so I created a little helper!

First, export (or add to your .zshrc file) an environment variable called `WEB_HOME` - e.g., `export WEB_HOME=/Users/jojorabbit/projects/web`

Then, you can use `npm start`. The first time I suggest adding `--dryRun`. Enjoy!
